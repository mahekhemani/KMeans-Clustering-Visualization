# KMeans Clustering Visualization

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive web application demonstrating the KMeans clustering algorithm with various initialization methods, including Random, Farthest First, KMeans++, and Manual. The app allows users to visualize the impact of different initialization strategies on clustering outcomes.

## Features

- **Initialization Methods**:
  - Random: Centroids are chosen randomly from the data points.
  - Farthest First: Initial centroids are chosen to be farthest apart.
  - KMeans++: Centroids are spread out to accelerate convergence.
  - Manual: Users select initial centroids manually via point-and-click.

- **Visualization**:
  - Dynamic 2D plot showing data points and centroids.
  - Step-by-step visualization of the clustering process.
  - Interactive manual selection of centroids.

- **User Interface**:
  - Drop-down menu to select initialization method.
  - Buttons to generate a new dataset, step through the clustering, or run to convergence.
